# Naive Bayes Trainer

This is the Trainer for the Naive Bayes classifier written from scratch that 
attempts to produce comparable results to <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/">MALLET</a>.  
In testing with the Bills_Data using the 2001-2013 sessions as training set and 2015 session as 
test set, this classifier achieves 72% accuracy while MALLET achieved 75%.  
It agrees with the MALLET classifier 82%.  Of the 18% disagreements 4% where 
the correct result.

The code is based on <a href="http://blog.datumbox.com/machine-learning-tutorial-the-naive-bayes-text-classifier/">
Machine Learning Tutorial: The Native Bayes Text Classifier </a> and examination of the MALLET code.
